Utilize the CCTV Network to monitor the streets and businesses of your Alt:V Server. With different CCTV computer posts and night vision capabilities, keep a vigilant eye on your surroundings.

- **Camera Categories:** Explore different camera categories, allowing surveillance of specific areas or businesses.
- **Night Vision:** Night vision is always on, providing visibility even in low-light conditions.
- **See-Through Option:** Utilize the see-through option to discreetly observe individuals.
- **Audio Monitoring:** Listen to audio from the camera area to stay informed of events.

This mod is made with and for Alt:V Server 4.0-rc1 (rc).

⚠️ **Important Note:** While this plugin works like a charm for Alt:V Server 4.0-rc1 (rc), I've hung up my GTAVRP coding hat. Sadly, I won't be updating it to the newest versions of Alt:V.
